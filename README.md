You want to use Blender
You open Blender and try to navigate like many other major 3D application
Nothing makes sense
You change to Industry Compatible keymap so you can navigate in 3D
Now none of the tutorials make sense because the shortcuts are different
You despair slightly
You go back to Maya, or Houdini, Unreal Engine, Unity, Cinema 4D, Modo, Substance Painter, Substance Designer, 3DCoat, Fusion, Mari, Clarisse iFX or even Nuke - where you know how to orbit your scene safely
.... Or
You load this plugin
You learn Blender
You get into Blender, having got around its biggest learning curve for people familiar with any other major 3D application
...maybe someday you'll learn to orbit-like-Blender too


That day is not today
Today is alt_maya_blender_ducktape day
